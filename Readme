# Fibonacci Sequence Application 
This suite consists of two console applications:
1. **FibonacciSequenceGenerator**: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to 233 and stores each number in Azure Queue Storage.
2. **MessageProcessor**: Retrieves the Fibonacci numbers from Azure Queue Storage and saves them to Azure File Storage as a text file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the applications, ensure you have the following:

- **.NET SDK**: Install the latest version of the .NET SDK from [Microsoft's website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- **Azure Storage Account**: Set up an Azure Storage account with both Queue Storage and File Storage.
- **Azure Storage SDK for .NET**: Required to interact with Azure Storage services.

## Application 1: Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This application generates the Fibonacci sequence up to 233 and stores each number in an Azure Queue Storage.

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd FibonacciSequenceGenerator
 Configure Azure Connection:
Open Program.cs and update the connectionString variable with your Azure Queue Storage connection string:

csharp
Copy code
string connectionString = "Your_Azure_Storage_Connection_String";  
Run the Application:
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute:

bash
Copy code
dotnet run  
This will generate the Fibonacci sequence up to 233 and store each number as a separate message in Azure Queue Storage.

Application 2: Message Processor
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>  
cd MessageProcessor  
Configure Azure Connections:
Open Program.cs and update the following variables with your Azure connection strings and file share information:

csharp
Copy code
string queueConnectionString = "Your_Azure_Queue_Storage_Connection_String";  
string fileConnectionString = "Your_Azure_File_Storage_Connection_String";  
string shareName = "yourfileshare";  // Replace with your actual file share name  
string fileName = "YourName-YourSurname.txt";  // Replace with your name  
Run the Application:
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute:

bash
Copy code
dotnet run  
This will process the messages from the Azure Queue Storage and save the Fibonacci sequence to a text file in Azure File Storage.
